#### Don’t let the name fool you, this soup isn’t overly “spicy,” at least not in the heat-your-mouth-up, Tabasco or hot sauce, kind of way. It simply has a lot of spices in it. The spice level also really depends on what type of salsa you add to it (mild, medium, or hot) to determine how spicy it will be. For mild flavor, add slightly less chili powder and choose a mild salsa. It’s a great soup to make in advance as it tastes even better over time, and you can load it with your favorite Mexican-style toppings, like cilantro, avocado, cotija cheese, and jalapeños.

## How to make spicy chicken soup:

#### **1. Boil the chicken:** In a large pot over medium heat, combine water, chicken, salt, pepper, garlic powder, parsley, onion powder and bouillon cubes. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 20-30 minutes or until chicken is cooked through. Remove chicken, but reserve broth. Shred chicken.

#### **2. Make the soup:** In a large pot over medium heat, cook onion and garlic in olive oil until slightly browned. Stir in salsa, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, sugar, chili powder, cumin, corn, chili beans, shredded chicken, and 3 ½ cups of the reserved water. Simmer 30 minutes.

#### **3. Garnish:** Stir in sour cream. Taste and add extra salt, or additional seasonings, if needed. Garnish with cilantro, cheese, avocado, crushed tortilla chips, or whatever you like!

## Make Ahead And Freezing Instructions:

#### **To make ahead:** This is a great soup to make the morning of or one day ahead of time. It will stay fresh for 3-4 days in the fridge, depending on the freshness of the ingredients used.

#### **To freeze:** Don’t add sour cream to the soup and then freeze in a freezer safe container for 2-3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight and reheat in the microwave or on the stovetop.
